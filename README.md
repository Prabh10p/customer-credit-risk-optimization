# 6. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
- The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase was crucial in understanding the dataset‚Äôs structure, relationships, and anomalies before moving into modeling.
- Key steps performed:
   - Missing Value Analysis: Identified and imputed missing values where applicable.
   - Outlier Detection: Detected anomalies in continuous variables like loan_amount and annual_income using boxplots and Z-score.
   - Distribution Checks: Visualized distributions of numeric and categorical features to detect skewness.
   - Correlation Heatmaps: Measured relationships between variables, highlighting potential multicollinearity.
   - Target Variable Relationship: Compared default rates across features like employment_length, credit_history_length, and loan_purpose.


# 7. ü§ñ Model Training & Evaluation
- We trained multiple ML models to identify the best-performing one for predicting loan default risk.
Models Tested

- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- XGBoost Classifier (boosted tree-based model with high accuracy potential)
- Approach:
  - Train-Test Split (80/20) to ensure unbiased evaluation.
  - Cross-Validation for robust performance measurement.
  - Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV for optimal model parameters.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.
| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|---------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.8741  |
| XGBoost Classifier  | 0.85     | 0.83     | 0.87    |


# 8üìä Model Interpretability
To ensure transparency and trust in our predictions, we used SHAP and LIME to interpret model behavior.

## SHAP Summary Plot

  <br>
  <em>SHAP summary plot showing feature impact on loan default prediction.</em>
</p>


From the SHAP summary plot:
- Loan Amount and Person Income are the most influential features in predicting credit risk.
- Higher Loan Amount and higher Loan Percent Income tend to increase default risk.
- Employment Duration and Person Age also play significant roles, with lower values often linked to higher risk.
- Certain categorical features like Home Ownership Type = RENT and Credit History Duration also have notable effects.
- Loan intent categories such as VENTURE, EDUCATION, and PERSONAL influence predictions differently depending on the context.

## LIME Local Explanation
<p align="center">

  <br>
  <em>LIME local explanation for a single customer instance.</em>
</p>

From the LIME explanation:

- For the specific customer examined, High Loan Amount and Low Person Income strongly increased the probability of default.
- A short Credit History Duration further contributed to higher predicted risk.
- Factors like Employment Duration and certain loan purposes reduced the risk slightly, but not enough to change the classification outcome.
